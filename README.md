# NCA_MNIST
This repository implements a Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) model for generating handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. The model, an enhanced NCA architecture, integrates digit-specific label embeddings to guide the generative process, improving digit awareness and reconstruction accuracy.
